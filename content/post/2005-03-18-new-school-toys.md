I don&#8217;t know if the is a left-wing or right-wing conspiracy, but I do know that these maybe the scariest toys I&#8217;ve ever seen. I was stopped at a red light in downtown Fredericksburg. I panned left and saw these other-dimensional play things plaster against the storefront window. I went back downtown today and took a picture. I had to document this to aid future generations when they try to figure out what went wrong.

I just returned from a reverse migration to Minnesota. It was a short but packed trip to the Northland. All in all a good mix of friends and family. Thanks to my [buddy](http://www.kevinjensen.com/ "Kevin Jensen") for providing his house as a venue for the great _McKinzie&#8217;s Back in Town Roundup_.

I did get to see my friend and high school/college hockey mate coach the [Rosemout Boys&#8217; Hockey](http://www.isd196.k12.mn.us/rhs/hockeyboys/ "Rosemout Irish Boys' Hockey") team in the 1st and 2nd rounds of playoffs. The had a solid first game against [Eastview](http://www.isd196.k12.mn.us/evhs/athletics/winter/boyshockey/ "Eastview Boys' Hockey") before meeting #1 ranked [Academy of Holy Angels](http://www.ahastars.org/activities/ "Academy of Holy Angels"). The Irish put up a good fight, but finally fell to a high school with a power play on par with most NCAA Division I hockey teams.

I received a gift from my aunt for working on her website, [www.maryellendesigns.com](http://www.maryellendesigns.com "Mary Ellen Designs"). The torch has been passed and now I am the proud owner of a [Bethany Housewares Heritage Grill](http://www.bethanyhousewares.com/products11.5-730.html "Bethany Housewares Heritage Grill") for making the family recipe [Lefse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefse "Lefse on Wikipedia"). With great power comes great responsibility. I accept humbly.

Also on this trip, I rectified a grave culinary offense committed against my home state by finally having a [Jucy Lucy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicy_Lucy) at [Matt&#8217;s Bar](http://www.mattsbar.com/) in South Minneapolis. After years of having iconic sandwiches in other cities ([Cheesesteak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesesteak) in Philly and [Primanti Brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primanti_Brothers_Restaurant) in Pittsburgh), I finally found and partook in the Minnesota equivalent. Top-notch in every way, even though it can inflict a mortal wound on your pie hole if the liquid hot magma cheddar center is not properly respected.

To top the trip off, we caught a [Wild](http://wild.com "Minnesota Wild Website") game Sunday at the [Excel Energy Center](http://www.xcelenergycenter.com/ "Xcel Energy Center Website"). The Wild beat the [Edmonton Oilers](http://www.edmontonoilers.com/ "Edmonton Oilers Website") [4-1](http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/boxscore?gameId=270225030 "ESPN.com Boxscore"). I got so caught up in the moment believing I was the one on the ice burning calories at a phenomenal rate that I had a inordinate amount of [fried cheese curds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_Cheese_Curds#Fried_cheese_curds "Fried Cheese Curds on Wikipedia"). Of course, what is a trip home to Minnesota without one incident of dairy overdose.

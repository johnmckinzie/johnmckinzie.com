Last Friday I had surgery on a lipoma on my back. Basically, it is a fatty deposit. Although I was sad to see the "cheese hump" go, it was the best thing to do. It didn't hurt all that much. I only took a couple aspirin after the surgery. I could not shower for 4 days to you can imagine that I was bringing the funk. The Jackson-Pratt tube that was in my back was pretty cool. It works like a reverse turkey baster and removes "juice" from the wound. It was a little nasty having to drain it and measure it. The only painful thing during the recovery was watching the Twins lose. I cannot complain about making the playoffs for the second consecutive year. Vikes and Gophers are undefeated and Minnesota hit a record of 85 and I saw a soon to be Virginia Ham streak across the blue sky. Out.

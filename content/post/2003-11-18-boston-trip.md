I spent last weekend in Boston visiting my friend Andy Stark. I haven&#8217;t been to Boston since 1996. Nothing has changed, it is still a great city. We caught the [Boston Bruins](http://www.bostonbruins.com) vs. [Vancouver Canunks](http://www.canucks.com) game on Saturday. Best NHL game I&#8217;ve seen to date. Boston ended up winning in OT with a minute left. The Bruins are a stacked team, but they play great together as a team. [Joe Thornton](http://www.bostonbruins.com/team/playerinfo.asp?playerid=265) was great to see play in person. He sees ice well and can shape the game. After the game, the [Dropkick Murphys](http://www.dropkickmurphys.com) played the Fleet Center. Anyone with a ticket could stick around. I would say about a fourth of the crowd stuck around to see a great show and a few Bruins join in the festivities. The next morning we went to breakfast at a great little restaurant called [Johnny&#8217;s Luncheonette](http://ae.boston.com/dining/restaurant/18) in Cambridge, right by Harvard. I had &#8220;The Deli&#8221;. It was scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and carmelized onions. I would recommend that everyone try it at Johnny&#8217;s or make it at home. Those are the highlights of my Boston trip. This weekend I&#8217;m off to Philly to see the Flyers vs. Bruins game. Expected an update from that.

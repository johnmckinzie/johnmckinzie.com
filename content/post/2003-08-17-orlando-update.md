So I&#8217;m in Orlando this week for a class. Haven&#8217;t done much down here yet. Plan on going to Cocoa Beach Friday night. Hopefully during the day Friday I can make it over to Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg area. I heard the beachs are beautiful. Just found out that there is a minor league baseball team called the [Isotopes](http://www.albuquerquebaseball.com). I wonder if you can see Homer in the outfield at the games. I plan on heading to downtown Orlando tonight. I guess it is supposed to be a deal down there on Wednesday nights. Alright, more updates from Orlando if anything worthwhile occurs.

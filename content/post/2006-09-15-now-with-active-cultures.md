Below is proof how much effort and sweat I&#8217;ve put into hockey and my equipment over the years. No, this is not a batch of split pea soup for Thanksgiving soup kitchens or a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day batch of home brew. This is 100% pure Johnny funk being washed down the drain, thus forcing me to start all over again building character into my hockey equipment.

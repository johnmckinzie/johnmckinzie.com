Last week was my first vacation of the summer. Ashley and I went up to Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA to be exact, to visit her relatives. We flew into Providence, RI last Wednesday night and drove a rental car to the Cape. <!--more-->

The first day started with a trip to the [Cape Cod Potato Chips](http://www.capecodchips.com) factory. [<img src="http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery/albums/CapeCod/P6240001.thumb.jpg" class="floatLeft" alt="Cape Cod Potato Chips Tour" />](http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery/CapeCod/P6240001)It is a short self-guided tour with some good samples at the end. We then hopped in the car and head up to the tip of the Cape. On the way, we stopped at a couple lighthouses. [Highland Lighthouse](http://www.trurohistorical.org) was interesting in that it was moved with the last decade 400+ feet due to an eroding coastline. 

Our final destination was [Provincetown](http://www.provincetown.com/), which is an odd town to say the least. Check out website for yourself. Provincetown does have a Portuguese heritage and this was evident in the incredible bakery, Provincetown Portuguese Bakery & Coffee Shop, where we stopped and had lunch. Our reason for driving to Pronvince town was to go whale watching aboard the Captian Red of [Portuguese Princess Excursions](http://www.princesswhalewatch.com/).

The next day we took the [ferry](http://www.steamshipauthority.com) in the morning out of Falmouth to [Martha&#8217;s Vineyard](http://www.mvol.com). We disembarked at Vineyard Haven and hopped a [bus](http://www.vineyardtransit.com) to [South Beach](http://www.mvy.com/islandinfo/beaches.html). The beach area was beautiful but the surf zone was quite rocky and a bear on the feet. We then hopped the bus again and headed for Oak Bluffs. This tends to be the vacation center of Martha&#8217;s Vineyard. They are famous for their &#8220;gingerbread houses&#8221; and also have nation&#8217;s oldest operating platform carousel, [The Flying Horses Carousel](http://www.mvpreservation.org/carousel.html). 

Saturday we spent a couple hours at a local beach and grabbed some lunch at McMenamy&#8217;s Seafoods. Great fried haddock and the best onion rings ever! That night we took in a [Falmouth Commodores](http://www.falcommodores.org) baseball game.[<img src="http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery/albums/CapeCod/27624569861_G.thumb.jpg" class="floatLeft" alt="Homer the Falmouth Commodore Mascot" />](http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery/CapeCod/27624569861_G) They are part of the [Cape Cod Baseball League](http://www.capecodbaseball.org) that has been the premier amateur baseball league in the nation since 1885. It is a summer wooden bat league for college players. The league was featured in the movie [Summer Catch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234829/).

The rest of the weekend was laid back. We went out fishing with a friend of Ashley&#8217;s counsin. The water was rough so we had only limited time with no success. The Sunday night dinner of [Clams Casino](http://southernfood.about.com/library/rec03/bl30115b.htm) [<img src="http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery/albums/CapeCod/27739343365_G.thumb.jpg" class="floatRight" alt="Clams Casino" />](http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery/CapeCod/27739343365_G)was a highlight of the trip.

Monday we headed back towards Providence. We stopped in Newport, RI to have lunch and kill a few hours. We grabbed a sandwich and sat on [Bowen&#8217;s Wharf](http://www.bowenswharf.com) on the waterfront. The [Spirit of Newport](http://www.bowenswharf.com/Pages/Waterfront/Spirit_of_Newport.html) harbor tours leave from Bowen&#8217;s wharf and last about an hour. It is a beautiful tours that winds through an incredible amount of sailboats and heads to the mouth of the bay. On our way out of town with took a drive past the amazing [Newport Mansions](http://www.newportmansions.org/). Some are opened for tours and all of them are amazing.

Now we are back home and planning for our next excursion. I placed [pictures from the trip](http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery/CapeCod) in my [gallery](http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery).

I&#8217;ll leave you all with this. I know I should not be talking about the &#8220;club&#8221;, but [this](http://www.seanbonner.com/blog/archives/000612.php#000612) is so great.

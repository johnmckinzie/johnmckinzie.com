Hi all! I have been slippin&#8217; when it comes to the posts. I have been pretty busy with work. It has included a lot of travel to Virginia Beach. Here are some recent highlights. Ashley and I went to [Luray Caverns](http://www.luraycaverns.com) in the Shenandoah Valley. Very cool! It is by far the largest cavern that I have visisted. It is a mile and a half walk through the cave with beautiful formations everywhere. Highlights include a couple amazing reflecting pools and an organ that uses the stalagtites and stalagmites to produces notes.

This previous weekend I travelled up to Philly to meet a friend from high school. As luck would have it, my other friend from Philly had tickets to Flyers/Devils Game 5. So I made my way up to Philly a little bit early to catch the spectacle. The Wachovia Center had a great atmosphere that day and an orange and black fur cover the stadium in total. Anyways, the Flyers won 3-1. After the game I met up with my other friend and we hit the town. I took my friend to one of my favorite spots in Philly, [McGillin&#8217;s Olde Ale House](http://www.mcgillins.com/) near center city. Need some sustinance, we made sure to hit [Jim&#8217;s Steaks](http://jimssteaks.com/) on South St.. After that, a good nite was had by all.

This weekend I am heading up to Lancaster, PA for and adult hockey tournament. Our team consists for some of the boys from the local hockey team. Since we are travelling on Friday, we were punished with 3 games on Saturday. A few of the old-timers are nervous and the young guns placing odds of individuals passing out doesn&#8217;t help. It should be a good time and maybe we&#8217;ll get some hardware to remember the glory days. I&#8217;ll have an update with the results and maybe some pictures/videos to boot.

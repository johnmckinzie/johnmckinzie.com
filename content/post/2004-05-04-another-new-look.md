I'm finally starting to get the hang of this content management system I'm using called [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) and how to integrate it into my website. I am realizing it's potentional and great design the more I dig into it. I did a little quick graphic work last night and this is what I came up with. It is fully functioning and should look good on any 4.0+ browser. I would recommend upgrading your browswer to 

[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org). It is the most standards compliant browswer out there and renders pages using CSS beautifully. I will be adding more content and trying to stabilize the look. I have a hard time sticking with something. I hope this site will become more useable and pleasing to the eye the more I work on it.

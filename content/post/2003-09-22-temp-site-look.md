Spent a couple hours and put together a new look for the site and does not cause dizziness and nausea. It will only be temporary while I search for time and inspiration for the next big thing. Hope to work on it some this weekend. The addition of a music section and a gallery are possibilities. Big game on Sunday. Vikes and Packers. Everyone best be showing there purple pride.

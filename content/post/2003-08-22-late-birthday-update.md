A few days have past since I celebrated my 26th birthday and I would like to reflect. GETTING OLD SUX!!! I had quite a nice birthday. My hockey team had our final regular season game and we are peaking at the right time. First playoff game is this weekend and we are it will be a rematch against the team we beat on Tuesday. I received one of the best gifts ever. It is a print by [Terrence Fogarty](http://www.terrencefogarty.com/), a well known sports painter from Minnesota. The picture, [Ice Legends](http://www.terrencefogarty.com/gallery/media/legends-l.jpg), is a still live of various memorabilia from all the hockey teams in the [MIAC](http://www.miac-online.org/). It was so thoughtful and I will keep it all of my days. On a sad note, definitive evidence that [mullets](http://www.mulletsgalore.com/) are harmful to ones health was discovered through [very unscientific means](http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/West/08/17/roller.coaster.death.ap/). Good day.

Puerto Rico was a great trip. It is a beautiful island with so much to offer. We spent a day in the rainforest called [El Yunque](http://www.southernregion.fs.fed.us/caribbean/). It is quite different from the rainforest in Guatemala. Not a humid or hot and it had very few bugs. A 20-30 hike would give you access to [La Mina Falls](http://cruises.about.com/library/pictures/mariner/blelyunque07.htm), in which you could take a dip in some cool mountain water. We also spent a day at one of the Top 10 Beaches in the world, [Flamenco Beach](http://www.culebrabeachrental.com/). Flamenco Beach is on the island of [Culebra](http://www.culebra.org/), which is of the northeast corner of Puerto Rico north of Vieques. I&#8217;ve never really found beaches that enticing until I stepped foot on this beach. I also spent some time in Fajardo and Luquillo. My friends had to leave a couple days before I did, so I spent the rest of the trip in [Old San Juan](http://welcome.topuertorico.org/city/sanjuan.shtml) in a great guesthouse. The city is out of place so close to the states with its old Spanish buildings and forts. The houses are colorful and the weather was amazing. Excellent food all around Puerto Rico. Some examples can be found [here](http://www.elboricua.com/recipes.html). I will be posting some pictures of the trip on my site at [JohnMcKinzie.com Gallery](http://www.johnmckinzie.com/gallery/). I will also have a post about this weekends Virgnia Pond Hockey 2004 escapades.

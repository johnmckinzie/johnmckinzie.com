It&#8217;s been about a month since the last update. Thought I&#8217;d post some news before the holiday season. I was in Philadelphia the weekend before Thanksgiving. I went to see a Flyer&#8217;s game. The were playing the Bruins. It was a fun game, but not a good as the Boston/Vancouver game the week before. The week after Christmas I spent at a conference in Orlando called [I/ITSEC](http://www.iitsec.org/). It is quite a large conference with over 15,000 people involved. It was an excellent learning experience and provided great exposure to the people in my line of work. Every night a exhibiting company threw some sort of after conference party. On Wednesday, there was one with single malt scotch whiskey and [Haggis](http://www.electricscotland.com/haggis/haggis1.html). The past few weeks have been slow. Just waiting for Christmas and my parents to visit. On the 27th, I will be in Puerto Rico for about 9 days. I&#8217;m going with a friend who is originally from there. I really excited. I especially want to see and swim in the [bioluminescent bays](http://www.biobay.com/). Hope everyone has a great Christmas and New Years!

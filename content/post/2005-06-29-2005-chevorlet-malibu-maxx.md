It's official. My dream of being a young hip designer has died with the trading in of my [2002 Volkswagen GTI](http://www.edmunds.com/used/2002/volkswagen/gti/100003548/review.html?tid=edmunds.u.options.leftsidenav..12.Volkswagen*), the conveyance of choice for the creative and artistic set. In its place now resides some American steel, the [2005](http://www.edmunds.com/new/2005/chevrolet/malibumaxx/100396662/researchlanding.html) [Chevorlet](http://www.chevrolet.com) [Malibu](http://www.chevrolet.com/malibu/) [Maxx](http://www.chevrolet.com/malibu/maxx/). I decided to dump the VW due to a high maintenance cost and just some general unreliability. I loved how it drove, but it was not the most economical choice.

Besides wanting to unloaded some of the financial burden the VW brought, I also wanted to switch to an American car. With the trade deficit at all-time highs and the quality of American cars improving greatly, I felt very strongly about helping the American worker. It's not corny or idealistic, its just the right thing to do. So when I saw the [Chevrolet Employee Discount Price](http://www.gm.com/employeediscount.do?brandId=ch&cmp=ch_com&version=0), I decided to do a little research.

I needed a pratical car with good gas mileage. I had almost discounted the Chevrolet line until I found that the Malibu's V-6 gets 22/32 MPG city/highway. Once I saw this and then found the 5-door Maxx variant, I had a viable option. [J.D. Power Consumer Center](http://www.jdpower.com/cc/auto/ratings/vehicles/FindJdAwards.jsp) (search for 2005 Chevrolet Malibu) convinced me I was on the right track. Coincidently, a couple hours before going to the dealership a friend sent me a link to [J.D. Power: Most reliable cars](http://www.cnn.com/2005/AUTOS/06/29/jdpower_depend_tops/index.html). The 2002, which in my opinion has been improved on, came in first for reliability for "entry mid-size car".

So, I went from a four-cylinder, turbo, 5-speed, German 3-door hatchback to a V-6, automatic, American 5-door sedan/wagon. Oh how the times change. The car comes pretty loaded in the LS version, in addition to below list of some of the more unique features on the vehicle.

  * Sunroof for rear passengers
  * Audio volume adjusts automatically to car speed
  * Remote start standard (starts air conditioning on based on ambient temperature)
  * Wireless headphones
  * Seperate audio controls in rear, allowing rear and wirless passengers to listen to seperate audio source
  * Adjustable table in trunk which can lay on floor or be used for tailgating

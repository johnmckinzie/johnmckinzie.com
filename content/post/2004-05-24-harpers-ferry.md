A couple weeks ago I went to [Harper's Ferry](http://www.nps.gov/hafe/). It is situated at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers in West Virginia. Amazing history in that area. It is unique in that it is a still a functioning town with a few blocks of it being the National Park. We plan to visit the again and either go canoeing or rafting down the Shenandoah.

On the way back to Virginia we stop a what we though was a vista point. We parked the car and proceeded down a trail we though would lead up to the lookout. After we realized the trail would not lead us to a spectacular view, we turned around and went back to the car. On our way back, we realized that the trail we were on was the [Appalachian National Scenic Trail](http://www.nps.gov/appa/).

At my suggestion, my friend Adam at [VMS Records](http://www.vmsrecords.com/) has put together a punk rock bowling night at our local [duckpin](http://www.ndbc.org/) [bowling](http://www.robinsweb.com/duckpin/) [establishment](http://norfolk.citysearch.com/profile/10605961/). It will be held the first Saturday of each month starting in January at [Bowlarama](http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&hs=Dbl&lr=&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&q=bowlarama&near=Norfolk,+VA&sa=X&oi=locald&radius=0.0&latlng=36846667,-76285556,15927444368073296137). I invite everyone to join us to experience the Americana that is duckpin, to cleanse your aural pallete of commerical radio drivel, and to admire the interior design of the bowling alley, which could have very well been the set for the opening to [Kingpin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116778/).

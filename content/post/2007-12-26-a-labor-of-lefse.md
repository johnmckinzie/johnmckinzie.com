At some point in our lives, we all have the opportunity to be unselfish and take up the task for carrying on a family tradition rather than just enjoying the tradition. With regards to my Norwegian heritage, my opportunities include [lefse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefse), [lutefisk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutefisk), and [pillaging vast swathes of Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking). My inability to obtain fresh Cod and the necessary amounts of [soda lye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide), prevented my attempt at the the second option, while societal moires and NATO handcuffed my ability to take a honest shot at the last option. So besides being the only viable option, I also had some additional motivation to make lefse.

Earlier this year, in gratitude for helping my aunt develop the [website for her handmade jewelry](http://maryellendesigns.com/), she outfitted me with all the [necessary implements to make lefse](http://www.bethanyhousewares.com). With the ability to make the lefse, also came the motivation. The week before Christmas, I received a rather disappointed sounding response from my aunt and my uncle (currently the family's lefse patriarch) to the fact that I had not attempted to make lefse myself. That, coupled with this being the first year I've hosted my parents for the holidays, drove me to scramble to whip up a batch of lefse last minute.

I prepared the potato mixed the previous night. The next day, after a long session yard work followed my some frantic house cleaning, I decide to make lefse regardless of my exhaustion. Following the directions given to me, albeit slowly, I was successful with my very first piece of lefse. My original plan was to only make a third of the batch, but my excitement carried me through the remainder. My [lefse stick](http://lefse%20stick) skills were Jedi like, while my rolling skills produce rather fractal results.

My father, being the official judge after years of eating my grandmother's lefse, gave mine a passing grade. Although I was a bit suspicious that nepotism was involved after he left for home leaving behind his care package of the remaining lefse.

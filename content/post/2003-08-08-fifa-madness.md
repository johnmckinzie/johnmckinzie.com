So, I have been getting a lot of pressure from the &#8220;people&#8221; at [Kinetic Media](http://www.kineticportal.com/) to acquire a copy of [FIFA 2003](http://www.easports.com/platforms/games/fifa2003/home.jsp) for the PC. Now I love the game, but it would put a hurting on my productivity. Add the ability to play on the Internet and you can kiss John McKinzie contributing anything positive to society away. I do not know if I could be considered a worthy opponent to [Kinetic Media](http://www.kineticportal.com/). Their entire management structure is made up of Minnesota soccer legends. If [Kinetic Media](http://www.kineticportal.com/) would act like real men and challenge me to Halo for the PC, Johnny would definitely rise to aplha male.

Being the hockey gun for hire that Ashley is, she was asked to play in two women's games in Raleigh, NC. This time the fee was considerablly higher than before, my coaching the team. In all seriousness, Ashley did not hold the team a hostage to get me the coaching position. I was asked by one of the players that plays in the Fredericksburg league.

We headed down Saturday morning and stayed with our friend Greg in Raleigh. We grabbed lunch at an excellent Lebanese/Mediterranean deli called [Neomonde](http://www.neomonde.com). After, we spent some time at a weekly flee market and picked up a Molson Golden sign for our Canadian friend. 

The games took place a the [RecZone](http://www.reczone.net), which is the practice facility for the [Carolina Hurricanes](http://carolinahurricanes.com). I gave a pre-game speech and went over some of the basics and hoped they would respond. I was a little nervous because our team only had two forwards and one defenseman on the bench, but the girls but me at ease early in the first periond. I was stunned by how well the players executed. I'm not saying everyone on the team was the most talented, but I ended up having a blast watching the girls play great hockey. Our team really did dominate both games and only allowed 7 shots in the second game.

Both games ended up being 4-0 wins, giving our 50+ year old goalie two shutouts. We had a couple first time goal scorers. Ashley had two highlight clips. One was a coast to coast rush that she finished with beautiful shot that she tucked low inside the far post. The other was slapshot from point that could only be described as "wicked hard".

That Saturady night we went out for a couple beers to a pub called the [Flying Saucer](http://www.beerknurd.com). It was a pub with hundred or so higher end selections. People would get a plate fixed to the wall with a phrase on it once they had finished a certian number of beers. It reminded me of an [Old Chicago](http://www.oldchicago.com), but with a more "beer snob" feel.

I'm not going to count my previous assistant coaching stints, so Coach McKinzie is going into retirement with a perfect 2-0 record. The gives me the highest winning percentage for a coach from [New Ulm](http://www.ci.new-ulm.mn.us/), MN, who went to St. Olaf, attended graduate school at Penn State and had a minimum of two games coached.
